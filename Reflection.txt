ICT for the 1st quarter was really challenging. I admit that I'm not the best when it comes to coding, so I really had a hard time. Learning about the different types of attributes and elements low-key made me interested in  the subject but that doesn't mean that I'm good at it. I wish to further improve in my coding skills and my interest in this subject. To be honest, I only look forward to the subject because of the teacher. Ms. Uminga really has a place in my heart since grade 7. I am also looking forward to further improve this portfolio because I'm unsatisfied with work.</p>
